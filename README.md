A collection of python modules and command line tools for processing image-based RNAi screens.

## Introduction

`rnaiutilities` provide a set of python modules and commandline scripts that can be used to process, convert, query and analyse imaged-based RNAi-screens.

The packages are designed for the following workflow:

* Download raw `mat` files from an openBIS instance or where ever your data lie. The `mat` files are supposed to be created by `CellProfiler`, i.e. platewise data-sets, where every file describes a single features for single-cells.
* Parse the downloaded data using `rnai-parse`: install the package, and process as described in the package folder. This generates a list of raw `tsv`s files or a bundled `h5` file. Until now the parser writes featuresets for *cells*, *perinuclei*, *nuclei*, *expandednuclei*,  *bacteria* and *invasomes*.
* Query the meta DB using ``rnai-query`` and create and combine datasets. For that first meta files generated from the step above are written into a database. Then the DB can be queried against to subset single *genes*, *sirnas*, *pathogens*, etc. and write the *normalized* results.

* To come: `rnai-analyse` for analysing large-scale RNAi screens.

## Installation

Make sure to have `python3` installed. `rnaiutilities` does not support
previous versions. The best way to do that is to download [anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) and create a
virtual [environment](https://conda.io/docs/using/envs.html).

Download the latest [release](https://github.com/cbg-ethz/rnaiutilities/releases) first and install it using:

```bash
  pip install .
```

If you get errors, I probably forgot some dependency.
